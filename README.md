Requires python3.5+ with the Flask and youtube-dl modules installed

Edit "videofolder" in `config.json` to have the path to an existing folder on your computer ( preferable a Raspberry Pi ) or a thumb drive / external HDD / external SSD.

For example, `/media/pi/Backups/yt-pi/videos` is a folder on my thumb drive.
